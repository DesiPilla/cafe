# Cafe: Predicting Physical Attractiveness with Deep Learning-Based Systems

## Abstract
The modern dating scene has been transformed by digital technologies. With the rise of social media apps such as Tinder and Bumble, finding a potential partner has never been so convenient. Can the process of finding a match be further digitized with deep learning techniques? This study explores the viability of using convolutional neural networks to create personalized matchmaking algorithms. Using transfer learning techniques, five architectures were appended to VGGNet, and trained on photos scraped from Google Images. Most networks were able to achieve an accuracy between 74% and 76%, competing with even the best wingman. This study also investigates how such models would perform on multiple images of a single person, which is intended to represent a dating profile. Most architectures exhibited reliable results, consistently giving the same label to four out of five images of a specific individual. Lastly, this paper explores the explainability of such models.

## Introduction
The way in which lovers are finding each other is, like all other domains, adapting to the wide-spread availability of technology. Popular dating apps such as Tinder, Bumble, and Plenty of Fish, among others, have amassed an estimated 30.4 million users in the United States and are expected to have 35.4 million users by 2024 [24]. The lure of these apps is that one can gain exposure to many potential partners quickly and conveniently. All a user must do is upload images of his- or herself, fill in some personal details, and explore. Most sites create a “match” if both users elect (anonymously) that they “like” the other user. This matching then enables the two users to communicate with each other and explore a potential relationship.

The efficacy of such apps for finding a long-term partner has been questioned by some; Bauman (2003) argues that the convenience of finding a partner undermines the principles of romance and courtship [3]. On mobile apps, the ease-of-use has made it easy to rapidly *swipe* (“like” or “dislike”) on others; Levy et al. (2019) found that male users spend 6.7 s evaluating a profile and female users spend 11.1 s [15]. Subtracted from this is the time required for face recognition, emotion awareness, and attraction preferences, which studies have found require 1 – 5 s for a person to process [28, 29, 30, 32]. This means online daters are spending only a few seconds making their decision. 

Researchers have found that physical attractiveness is often the most important contributor when forming an impression of a potential partner [19]. However, Kniffin and Wilson (2004) found that non-physical features that were learned only after interacting with others played a significant role in one’s attractiveness; a person’s initial assessment of someone’s physical attractiveness was different after obtaining further impressions through group activities. On dating apps, however, these personality traits are largely unavailable, save for self-reported characteristics in one’s bio. As evidenced by Levy et al. (2019), most swiping decisions are made in just enough time to process a user’s physical appearance.


### Motivation and problem statement
With the number of online singles growing, a person can get lost viewing profiles for many hours, never finding a single match. Waiting for your profile to be shown to others (and liked) can take time as well. On Tinder, a user can even be shown profiles they have already disliked as the pool of unviewed profiles dries up [27]. It has also been claimed that Tinder displays users that have already swiped left on you, in which case swiping on those profiles are meaningless. By increasing the volume and availability of prospective partners, these apps have also added an unintended inefficiency to this process. These undesirable app features, however, may be aimed more at maintaining a user base and following a business model than at efficient matchmaking.

To reduce wasted time, we propose using Deep Learning and transfer learning methods to automatically classify profiles for a given user. By training a personal algorithm, all matching would be done instantly (or in the required computational time to predict all profiles in the user-base) upon signing up for the service. Similar business models have been seen in social media apps such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Most recently, TikTok has exploited a prediction-based AI recommendation system for content feeds to foster substantial user-engagement rates. This is a large reason the average user spends 52 minutes per day on the app and the value of their parent company, ByteDance, grew to $75 million in November 2018 [7]. 

This study aims to provide a proof-of-concept for the idea and to define a model architecture that can be used generally to solve this task. Specifically, the model architecture was trained to predict physical attractiveness of a woman’s face according to the author’s personal preferences.


### Related works

Brozovsky and Petricek (2007) suggested collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms as an improvement on global algorithms [5]. These user-specific functions were better at producing a list of 10 profile recommendations for individuals that initially rated 150 profiles. Krzywicki et al. (2014) notes that standard profile matching algorithms are susceptible to “over-recommending” popular profiles [14]; this underscores the issue with a greedy approach used in certain online dating services. The study also found that including an additional rating system based on important user-specific features improved the success rate of real-life interactions.

Approaches using instance-based learning on user-specified features (eye color, hair color, age, hobbies, etc.) was found to have positive results as the user labeled increasing amounts of data [17]. Joel et al. (2017) used random forests on user-specified features to predict desire among individuals [10]. The results suggested that relationship science can meaningfully estimate people’s tendencies to desire others in general, but not to desire a single person in particular over others. That is, the distinction between predicting general attractiveness and unique allure requires different methodology.

Transfer learning techniques have been used to approach this classification problem. Vries and Yosinski (2015) compared the fine-tuned performance on two different pretrained models to classify attractiveness [31]. The first model was inspired by VGGNet [23] with fine-tuning layers added to the end. The second model was a similar convolutional neural network that was pre-trained on gender classification before fine-tuning. The VGGNet outperformed the gender classifier when classifying the attractiveness of 9,364 Tinder profile pictures. The fine-tuned VGGNet model obtained a 68.1% accuracy on the test set and performed subjectively well. The study also estimated the difficulty level of this task. After one week, the author who originally labeled the images according to his own personal preferences re-labeled a random sample of 100 images; this timeframe was chosen so the author would not remember or recognize any faces. Despite using his own preferences, he was only able to attain an 88% accuracy on the sample. The authors estimate from this that roughly 24% of images are not consistently labeled by humans, with approximately 12% defining a lower-bound on any error rates sought after for this task.

Though its underlying algorithm techniques are not publicly known, *iris* is a new dating app that claims to use artificial intelligence to learn what type of person a user finds visually attractive [9]. Dubbed “AttractionDNA”, the company implements a seemingly commercialized solution to the task this study will focus on.

To uncover the mystery behind how neural networks arrive at their outputs, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation was proposed as an improvement to sensitivity analysis [22]. This technique decomposes the learned function, assigning relevance to more active neurons and stronger edges. This propagates backwards to the input layer, at which point all input features (pixels, in this case) are given a *relevance score*. This score can be positive, meaning it helped support the final classification, or negative, meaning it contradicted the decision. The magnitude of these scores is proportional to the expected importance of the input values.

## Methods and data
The example task is to predict whether the author, a 20-year-old white male, would classify a photo of a woman to be pretty or not. The profiles this type of user would be exposed to include women between the ages of 18 and 25 (approximately) of all races, with perhaps a larger proportion of white women than other ethnicities.

## Google Images data
The first set of data used in this study was a collection of 1,040 representative images of young women that were scraped from Google. These images were used to train a model to predict preferences for potential partners.
