# Cafe: Predicting Physical Attractiveness with Deep Learning-Based Systems

## Abstract
The modern dating scene has been transformed by digital technologies. With the rise of social media apps such as Tinder and Bumble, finding a potential partner has never been so convenient. Can the process of finding a match be further digitized with deep learning techniques? This study explores the viability of using convolutional neural networks to create personalized matchmaking algorithms. Using transfer learning techniques, five architectures were appended to VGGNet, and trained on photos scraped from Google Images. Most networks were able to achieve an accuracy between 74% and 76%, competing with even the best wingman. This study also investigates how such models would perform on multiple images of a single person, which is intended to represent a dating profile. Most architectures exhibited reliable results, consistently giving the same label to four out of five images of a specific individual. Lastly, this paper explores the explainability of such models.
